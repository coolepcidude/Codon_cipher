# Codon Cipher

A simple custom cipher tool inspired by the genetic codon table. This tool encodes and decodes characters using a unique 3-digit codon system, allowing for fun experimentation with encryption and obfuscation.

## How It Works

Each character (letter, number, or symbol) is assigned a unique 3-digit code based on its position in a 4Ã—4Ã—4 grid. For example:

- `A` â†’ `111`
- `B` â†’ `121`
- `C` â†’ `131`
- and so on...

Decoding reverses the process.

##  Features

- Encode any supported character into a codon
- Decode codons back into readable text
- Case-insensitive input (A = a)
- Clean, responsive interface

## Future Ideas

- Dark mode toggle
- Custom codon mappings
- Clipboard copy buttons
- Mobile-friendly enhancements
